# Gesture Controlled Mouse

  An idea started in hack-a-thon which is further continued to make a finished product, GCM is a great utility tool for lazy people/ presentation users.
  
  
  It can make use of hand gestures to have control over desktop mouse mainly using OpenCV and pynput.
  
  Future Scope:
  
    Converting basic Image Processing into Machine Learning to enable custom gesture-action combo
  
    Addition of special gestures for built-in windows apps
    
    Adding recognization of a specific color, so that object can be used instead of hand
    
    Improvising the accuracy and reducing noise
    
    Using finger counts to add more possibilites
    
    Using Voice Control to enable the script(Saving battery)
